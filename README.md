# Usability Testing Assignment - RMIT Library Website

This project involves conducting a usability test on the RMIT Library website to identify usability problems and provide recommendations for improvements. The usability test was performed based on heuristic analysis using Nielsen's heuristics and a set of predefined tasks for participants. This README provides an overview of the contents and structure of the usability testing report.

## Overview
The usability testing was conducted to assess the usability issues of the RMIT Library website (www.rmit.edu.au/library) and recommend solutions to enhance user experience. The test was performed using a remote observational approach, focusing on three main tasks:
1. Place a hold on a book.
2. Book a computer at a specified location and time.
3. Book a study room using the RMIT Library website.

## Files Included
- **Usability_Test_Report.pdf**: The comprehensive report containing the heuristic analysis, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
- **Consent Form**: Participant information and consent forms used during the test.
- **Appendices**:
  - Test protocol and predefined tasks.
  - Transcripts of observations.
  - Consolidated user feedback.
  - Results from post-task questionnaires.

## Heuristic Analysis
A heuristic analysis was performed using Nielsen's heuristics on the RMIT Library website. The analysis covered the three main tasks and evaluated elements such as:
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention

Key findings highlighted both positive aspects and areas for improvement, such as consistent design across devices, the layout of filters, and the need for better user control during cancellations.

## Usability Test Methodology
- **Participant Recruitment**: Target users were recruited through friends, acquaintances, and students at RMIT. A screening survey was used to form user profiles.
- **Test Strategy**: A remote testing strategy was employed, with participants performing tasks while thinking aloud. Mouse clicks, task completion times, and user feedback were recorded for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: A combination of qualitative data (from post-task surveys) and quantitative data (e.g., time taken, number of clicks) was used to derive insights into the user experience.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Place a hold on a book.
  2. Book a computer using specified location and time.
  3. Book a study room.

## Findings and Recommendations
The findings from the usability tests indicated several key usability issues:
1. **Task 1 - Place a hold on a book**:
   - **Positive**: Suggestion of related publications and citation-saving options.
   - **Problem**: Lack of book cover images on mobile devices.
   - **Recommendation**: Display book cover images to help users identify books quickly.

2. **Task 2 - Book a Computer**:
   - **Problem**: Confusing timesheet layout and lack of clear instructions for cancellations.
   - **Recommendation**: Redirect first-time users to a "Quick Booking" section and improve the cancellation process with confirmation dialogues.

3. **Task 3 - Book a Study Room**:
   - **Problem**: Filters occupy too much vertical space.
   - **Recommendation**: Convert filters into a dropdown menu to save screen space and reduce scrolling time.

Implementing these recommendations can improve the user experience on the RMIT Library website.

## References
The heuristic analysis was guided by Interaction Design Foundation's articles on Nielsen's heuristics. Full references can be found in the report.

## Appendices
- **Appendix I**: Contains the test protocol, including the tasks assigned to participants.
- **Appendix II**: Provides the full transcripts of participant observations and feedback.
- **Appendix III**: Displays the results from post-task surveys, including visual data representations.
- **Contribution Statement**: Details each group member's contributions to the project.

## Conclusion
The usability testing and heuristic analysis revealed several areas of improvement for the RMIT Library website, which, when addressed, can enhance user satisfaction and website traffic. The full report provides a detailed breakdown of the methodology, findings, and recommendations for the client.
